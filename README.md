# NearestNeighbor
Machine Learning Nearest Neighbors implementation in C
To compile, run this:

gcc nearestneighbors.c -o nearestneighbors.o -lm -lpthread

To use, run this:

./nearestneighbors.o

This is still under development. I want to add Iris Data as thats the defacto test for all this stuff these days. After thats in, I want to add some timing to see how fast it is compared to something written in python.
